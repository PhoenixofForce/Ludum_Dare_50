## Ludum Dare 50
Im am using the current state of my [Engine](https://github.com/PhoenixofForce/LWJGL_Engine) to make a game for the 50th [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50) and test its functionality.

This is going to be a point and click game in which you have to defeat your urge to sleep
